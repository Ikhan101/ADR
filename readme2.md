## ADR

ADR

## Context

For the attendance system we have to figure out what kind of database are we using is such as relational database and non-relational database.

## Decision

As a group we have decided to use the relational database for the Attendance system.

## Rationale

1. So one of the pros about relational database is that the data is easily structured into categories.
2. The second benefit of using a relational database is that the data is consistent in input and meaning easy to navigate
3. The third benefit of using a relational database is that the relationships can be easily defined between data points.

## Implications

The adoption of relational databse within the student attendance system provides detailed database and detailed structure.

## Status

This ADR is successful and approved of every team member of the team, and we are actively using the the relational database for our project management.
