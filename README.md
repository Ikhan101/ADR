ADR

## Context
At the school, we have adopted the agile methodologies for our software development process. This document (ADR) outlines the reasons why we are using agile and the reasons behind our decisions and benefits of agile to our project.

## Decision
As a group we have decided to use Agile methodologies for our software development project. This is because the agile approach is very flexible and most familiar with every member of the group. Agile methodology is an approach that allows us as a team to have a very flexible environment since this allows us  

## Rationale 
1.	Flexible and adaptable: using agile methodologies, such as scrum offers the team to have flexibility in the project. This allows us to quickly adapt to changing the requirements of a software based on the customers feedback. Using the scrum agile approach allows us to adapt and ensure that we are evolving with the market needs.
2.	Improvement: using agile allows the team for continuous improvement. By having regular meet ups with the team you are able to identify areas for enhancement and make adjustments to ensure it meets the clients purpose. 
3.	Stakeholder involvement: using agile allows you to involve the stakeholders throughout the development process. They can provide with feedback that then could be used for the team to make any adjustments and check with the stakeholders. This allows the team to change and aligns any change to ensure it meets the business objectives. 


## Implications
The adoption of Agile methodologies at the school will require changes in project management practices, communications structures, and workflow process. It necessitates a commitment to the agile principles and practices and ongoing training for team members to ensure successful implementation.

## Status
This ADR is successful and approved of every team member of the team, and we are actively using the agile methodology for our software architectural development project.
